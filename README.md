General integration workflow guide:

Note: using apps like gitkraken or githubDesktop will make viewing and commiting changes easier. 
      But commandline works perfectly fine if you know what you are doing.

1. Always branch and work on local first.
2. Pull from master, fix conflicts and bugs locally before pushing to master.
3. Annouce push to master on Discord before commiting the push to minimize update clashes, 
   mainly so that no two people are pushing at the same time,which willcause a lot of problems.
4. Add local only files to .gitignore, 
   such as .cbp and .depend files generated by CodeBlock.
5. Clean up your own shit.

EX: Anyone that breaks master will have to buy everyone else a meal.
